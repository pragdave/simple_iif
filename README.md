# SimpleIif

A trivial library to assist in handling QuickBooks iif files.

I know: iif is a deprecated format. But it's all I have to play with on QuickBooks for Mac.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'simple_iif'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install simple_iif
